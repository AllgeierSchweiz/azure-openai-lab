      "\n",
      "### Braised Veal Roast with Vegetables and Herbs\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2-3 lbs veal roast\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons butter\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons oil (olive or vegetable)\n",
      "- 4 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks\n",
      "- 2 onions, chopped\n",
      "- 4-5 sprigs of fresh parsley\n",
      "- 1-2 bay leaves\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or a few sprigs of fresh thyme)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper, to taste\n",
      "- 4-6 slices of bacon, chopped\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare the Veal**: Pat the veal roast dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper on all sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sear the Meat**: In a large, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven, heat the butter and oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the veal roast and sear it on all sides until browned (about 4-5 minutes per side). Remove the roast and set it aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cook the Bacon**: In the same pot, add the chopped bacon and cook until it is crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set it aside with the veal.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sauté the Vegetables**: Add the chopped onions and carrot chunks to the pot. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots start to soften.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Add Herbs**: Add the bacon back into the pot along with the parsley sprigs, bay leaves, and thyme. Stir everything together.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Deglaze the Pot**: If there's any residue stuck to the bottom of the pot, you can add a splash of water or broth to deglaze it, scraping any bits off the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Braise the Veal**: Return the veal roast to the pot, nestling it among the vegetables. You can add enough water or broth to partially submerge the roast (about halfway). Bring the liquid to a simmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Cover and Bake**: Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Bake for about 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the veal is tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Check Seasoning**: Once done, remove the pot from the oven. Taste the braising liquid and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Serve**: Slice the veal roast and serve it with the braised vegetables and some of the cooking liquid spooned over the top. Garnish with additional parsley if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Enjoy!\n",
      "This braised veal roast is great served with mashed potatoes, crusty bread, or over rice to soak up the delicious sauce. Enjoy your flavorful and hearty meal!\n",
