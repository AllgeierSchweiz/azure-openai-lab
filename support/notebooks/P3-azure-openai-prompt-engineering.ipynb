      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2-pound veal roast\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons butter\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons oil\n",
      "- 4 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks\n",
      "- 2 onions, quartered\n",
      "- 4 parsley sprigs\n",
      "- 1 bay leaf\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon thyme leaves\n",
      "- Salt and pepper, to taste\n",
      "- 4 slices bacon\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, heat the butter and oil over medium-high heat. Add the veal roast and sear it on all sides until browned. Remove the roast from the skillet and set it aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the same skillet, add the carrots, onions, parsley sprigs, bay leaf, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Sauté the vegetables for about 5 minutes until they begin to soften.\n",

      "4. Place the veal roast on top of the sautéed vegetables in the skillet. Lay the bacon slices over the top of the roast.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Cover the skillet with a lid or aluminum foil and transfer it to the preheated oven. Roast for about 1 hour or until the veal reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare or 160°F (71°C) for medium.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Once the veal roast is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Serve the veal roast with the bacon and herb-infused vegetables. Spoon some of the pan juices over the sliced roast for extra flavor.\n",
